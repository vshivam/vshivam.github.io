description: An open source project built by contributors from around the world, that helps you protect your content in the wild. It gives you more than privacy, it gives you security and enables you to protect your content from being exposed in the long run.

Privly is open source ecosystem of browser extensions, mobile applications that helps you protect your content in the wild. It gives you back your personal data by hiding the content behind a user-controlled hyperlink. Meaning your content stays your content.

Over the past two years I have been actively involved with the development of the mobile versions of Privly. Initially as a _Google Summer of Code 2013_ Student and then as a maintainer of the Privly-Android Project.  

In the [latest commit](https://github.com/privly/privly-android/tree/21351ed05eba07ed433a8dd1a57cdbebae79aece), the application allows us to seamlessly create new Privly content using the Plainpost and Zerobin applications and view the history of all our created content. It also has an experimental support for reading Privly content from gmail, facebook and twitter and I'm currently working on making the reading experience better.
