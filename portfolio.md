The number of networked “smart devices” available in everyday environments is rapidly increasing; however, most adopt mutually incompatible networks, protocols, and application programming interfaces. 

Ambient Flow provides a set of novel smart space design tools, which enable non-programmers to visually “remix” their ambient environments in new, playful and potentially unforeseen ways using an intuitive flow-graph model.

Developed an application on the Android platform for optimized location tracking
of two hundred study participants.

The study is currently underway and a part of the Dengue Fever study from the NUS Saw Swee School of Public Health and NUS School of Computing in collaboration with the Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore. The study aims to identify the types of places and location where they may be high incidences of mosquito breeding and dengue infection. 

It could then guide vector control measures which could be carried out to reduce the incidences of mosquito breeding and dengue infection in those locations.
