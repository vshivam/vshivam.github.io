The number of networked “smart devices” available in everyday environments is rapidly increasing. However, most adopt mutually incompatible networks, protocols, and application programming interfaces. 

Ambient Flow provides a set of novel smart space design tools, which enable non-programmers to visually “remix” their ambient environments in new, playful and potentially unforeseen ways using an intuitive flow-graph model.
