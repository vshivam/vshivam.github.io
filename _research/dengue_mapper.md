An application on the Android platform for analyzing the movement patterns of a hundred
dengue patients along with a hundred control users in Singapore. The application aims to be highly non-intrusive, using a set of sensible defaults and once started, only requires user interaction after the completion of the study by prompting the user with an uninstall message.

The study is currently underway and a part of the Dengue Fever study from the NUS Saw Swee School of Public Health and NUS School of Computing in collaboration with the Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Singapore. The study aims to identify the types of places and location where there may be high incidences of mosquito breeding and dengue infection. 

It could then guide vector control measures which could be carried out to reduce the incidences of mosquito breeding and dengue infection in those locations.
