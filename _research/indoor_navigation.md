title: Indoor Navigation System (Ongoing)
description : In this project, we present the design of an Indoor Navigation System using the accelerometer and magnetometer sensors available in a smartphone with minimal external local infrastructure support. The system proposes a novel way of providing a set of Points of Interest(POI) at the user's current location to help with the navigation system.
