In this project, we designed an end-to-end system for indoor navigation using off-the-shelf smartphones. The proposed approach uses a web based architecture to generate an indoor map based on tags between panoramic images and respective step counts.

The application then uses smartphone sensor data for a Dead-reckoning based localization technique to estimate the user's current location. Visual feedback is provided as the user moves around in the indoor environment.
