In this project, we designed an end-to-end system for indoor navigation using off-the-shelf smartphones. The proposed approach uses a web based architecture to generate an indoor map based on the links between panoramic images uploaded to the server with the help of our Map Maker application.

The application then uses smartphone sensor data for a Dead-reckoning based localization technique to estimate the user's current location. Visual feedback is provided as the user moves around in the indoor environment.
