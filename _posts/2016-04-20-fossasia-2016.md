[FOSSAsia](http://2016.fossasia.org/) is an annual free and open source software conference for anyone remotely interested in learning more about open source. 

I personally feel that attending any FOSS event is a great way to get introduced to amazing projects that I'll probably not hear of otherwise. One such really interesting project at FOSSAsia was the Clojure Image Synthesis Kit or [Clisk](https://github.com/mikera/clisk), a library for procedural image generation. Check out [this](https://twitter.com/tweegeemee) twitter bot to see it in action. For someone like me who has never done anything of this sort it was nothing short of amazing!

Some other interesting projects that I got introduced to (or learnt more about): 

* [GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql)
* [The Physical Web](https://github.com/google/physical-web)
* [The Julia Programming Language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
* [Ring](https://ring.cx/)

Secondly, it's a great way to talk to the core developers of softwares that I use daily and ask them some hard hitting questions or simply thank them for the great work they've been doing. Looking at you there Github and VLC.   

Finally, I also got the opportunity to talk about the work we've been doing at the Ambient Computing Research Group at NUS. All of our code is open source and you can check it out [here](https://bitbucket.org/dynamixdevelopers/).

Here's me talking about Ambient Dynamix.

A big shout out to the folks at [engineers.sg](http://engineers.sg) for the video. Cheers! :)
