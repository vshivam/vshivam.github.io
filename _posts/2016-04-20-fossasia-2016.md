[FOSSAsia](http://2016.fossasia.org/) is an annual free and open source software conference for anyone remotely interested in learning more about open source. 

I personally feel that attending any FOSS event is a great way to get introduced to projects that I'll probably not hear of otherwise. One such really cool project is the Closure Image Synthesis Kit or [Clisk](https://github.com/mikera/clisk). Check out [this](https://twitter.com/tweegeemee) twitter bot to see what I'm talking about!  

Some other interesting projects that I got introduced to (or learnt more about) : 

* [GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql)
* [The Physical Web](https://github.com/google/physical-web)
* [The Julia Programming Language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)
* [Ring](https://ring.cx/)

Secondly, it's a great way to talk to core developers of softwares that I use daily and ask them some hard hitting questions or simply thank them for the great work they've been doing. Looking at you there Github and VLC.   

Most importantly, I also got the opportunity to talk about the work I've been doing with the Ambient Computing Research Group at NUS. 

So, here's me talking about Ambient Dynamix.
