Hi! I'm Shivam Verma and I currently work as an Internet of Things researcher at the [School of Computing, NUS](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

I graduated from the [Goa Campus of BITS Pilani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani_%E2%80%93_Goa_Campus) with a Bachelors in Information Systems and prior to joining NUS, I worked as a Software Developer at [Teewe](http://teewe.in/) in Bangalore, India.

Apart from anything tech related, I love [traveling](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=16blXRsHiwmT__K99uxg3XZPFb84) and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/7377751-shivam-verma?shelf=read). Though I don't really do either of them as much as I would like to.

Hit me up if you need some <small>(maybe useless)</small> advice or someone to tag along with you in your next adventure.
